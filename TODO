# TODO:
# - Add downloading resume for directory of links
# - Add support for single files
# - Store list of already downloaded files in working directory
# - Ask user if resume file is already exists and new are gonna be created
# - Support for subfolders (-r arg)
# - Create directory (-p0, like in patch)
# - python3 ready
# - run via env
# - WgetInstance shouldn't return get_status_as_string. Formatting is not its responsibility

Experimental:
# - Dump resolved url (probably with resolved IP) and downloading using this dump information
# - Configuration file, that supports downloaded urls, information that everything was downloaded, etc
